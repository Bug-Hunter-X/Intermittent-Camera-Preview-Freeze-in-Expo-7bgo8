This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with certain device configurations.  The preview might freeze or become unresponsive, particularly after switching between camera modes or facing cameras. This isn't consistently reproducible across all devices, making debugging difficult. The error doesn't always result in a clear error message in the console, instead exhibiting visual glitches only.
