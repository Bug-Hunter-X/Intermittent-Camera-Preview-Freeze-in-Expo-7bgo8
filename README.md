# Expo Camera Preview Freeze Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API. On some devices, the camera preview freezes or becomes unresponsive after switching between camera modes (photo/video) or cameras (front/rear). This issue is intermittent and doesn't always produce a clear error message in the console.

## Reproducing the Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the code that reproduces this bug, while the solution is found in `bugSolution.js`.

The bug is more likely to occur on older devices or devices with limited resources.

## Solution

The solution involves adding more robust error handling and potentially using asynchronous operations to manage camera state changes more effectively.  The `bugSolution.js` provides an example of this approach.
